## Access Control & Sample Data

This app uses three roles: `user`, `admin`, and `super_admin`.

- Only `admin` accounts are allowed to sign in to the web app at this stage.
- Login attempts are tracked in the `login_attempts` table (success/failure, IP, UA).
- Repeated failures are rate limited and locked out for 15 minutes after too many attempts.

### Seeded Users

Run the migrations and seeders to create sample users:

```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

Sample accounts:

- Admin (allowed to login)
  - Email: `admin@wazaelimu.tld`
  - Password: `Admin@12345`
  - Role: `admin`

- Standard User (not allowed to login yet)
  - Email: `user@wazaelimu.tld`
  - Password: `User@12345`
  - Role: `user`

- Super Administrator (not allowed to login yet)
  - Email: `super@wazaelimu.tld`
  - Password: `Super@12345`
  - Role: `super_admin`

### Notes

- To change the app/site name, set `APP_NAME="wazaelimu"` in `.env` and run `php artisan config:clear`.
- Ensure branding files exist: `public/logo.png` and `public/favicon.ico`.
- For production cookie security, configure `.env`: `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true`, `SESSION_HTTP_ONLY=true`, `SESSION_SAME_SITE=lax` and set `APP_ENV=production`, `APP_DEBUG=false`.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
